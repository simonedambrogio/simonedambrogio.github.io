I am a PhD student in Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford, where I work with Professor Matthew Rushworth and Professor Laurence Hunt. 

I am interested in understanding how the brain learns models of the world and uses them to guide flexible, adaptive behavior. My research involves studying humans and non-human primates as they make decisions in carefully designed laboratory tasks, while measuring their brain activity using high-resolution brain imaging. It also involves building RL models that perform the same tasks to better understand how the brain processes information and guides behavior. I am particularly interested in new approaches that combine modern machine learning with standard models in cognitive science to make new discoveries about the algorithms that the brain uses to process information and make decisions.
